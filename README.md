# Tufte styled Box Plot using Stata
The code will be looking at replicating the Tufte styled box plot from Edward Tuftes' famous book "Visual Display of Quantitative Information". <br/>
<br/>
I will be making use of sample data from within Stata to demonstrate how we are able to achieve this. There are multiple methods of doing this however, in this version I shall mainly be working with macros to try and automate this task as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
This repository contains a Do-File to help you go through the process. If there are any questions, feel free to drop a comment.
